# Plan With Team

Create a detailed implementation plan based on the user's requirements provided through the `USER_PROMPT` variable. Analyze the request, think through the implementation approach, and save a comprehensive specification document to `PLAN_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY/<name-of-plan>.md` that can be used as a blueprint for actual development work. Follow the `Instructions` and work through the `Workflow` to create the plan.

## Variables

USER_PROMPT: $1
ORCHESTRATION_PROMPT: $2 - (Optional) Guidance for team assembly, task structure, and execution strategy. Supports optional parameters: `max_rounds` (cap research/planning iterations), `max_agents` (cap total agents deployed).
BRIEF_TEMPLATE: `.claude/templates/brief-template.md` - When USER_PROMPT is short or ambiguous, apply this template structure (Situation, Goal, Constraints, Key Question) to organize the request before research.
PLAN_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY: `ai_docs/`
TEAM_MEMBERS: `.claude/agents/team/*.md`
GENERAL_PURPOSE_AGENT: `general-purpose`
RESEARCH_AGENTS:
  - `scout-report-suggest` (opus) x3 — deep analysis scouts
  - `scout-report-suggest-fast` (sonnet) x5 — fast sweep scouts

## Instructions

- **PLANNING ONLY**: Do NOT build, write code, or deploy agents. Your only output is a plan document saved to `PLAN_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY`.
- If no `USER_PROMPT` is provided, stop and ask the user to provide it.
- If `ORCHESTRATION_PROMPT` is provided, use it to guide team composition, task granularity, dependency structure, and parallel/sequential decisions.
- Carefully analyze the user's requirements provided in the USER_PROMPT variable
- Determine the task type (chore|feature|refactor|fix|enhancement) and complexity (simple|medium|complex)
- Think deeply (ultrathink) about the best approach to implement the requested functionality or solve the problem
- Understand the codebase directly without subagents to understand existing patterns and architecture
- Follow the Plan Format below to create a comprehensive implementation plan
- Include all required sections and conditional sections based on task type and complexity
- Generate a descriptive, kebab-case filename based on the main topic of the plan
- Create a folder `ai_docs/<YYYYMMDD>_<descriptive-name>/` (using `$(date +%Y%m%d)_<kebab-case-name>`) and save as `implementation_spec.md` inside it
- Ensure the plan is detailed enough that another developer could follow it to implement the solution
- Include code examples or pseudo-code where appropriate to clarify complex concepts
- Consider edge cases, error handling, and scalability concerns
- Understand your role as the team lead. Refer to the `Team Orchestration` section for more details.

### Team Orchestration

As the team lead, you have access to powerful tools for coordinating work across multiple agents. You NEVER write code directly - you orchestrate team members using these tools.

#### Task Management Tools

**TaskCreate** - Create tasks in the shared task list:
```typescript
TaskCreate({
  subject: "Implement user authentication",
  description: "Create login/logout endpoints with JWT tokens. See specs/auth-plan.md for details.",
  activeForm: "Implementing authentication"  // Shows in UI spinner when in_progress
})
// Returns: taskId (e.g., "1")
```

**TaskUpdate** - Update task status, assignment, or dependencies:
```typescript
TaskUpdate({
  taskId: "1",
  status: "in_progress",  // pending → in_progress → completed
  owner: "implementer-auth"   // Assign to specific team member
})
```

**TaskList** - View all tasks and their status:
```typescript
TaskList({})
// Returns: Array of tasks with id, subject, status, owner, blockedBy
```

**TaskGet** - Get full details of a specific task:
```typescript
TaskGet({ taskId: "1" })
// Returns: Full task including description
```

#### Task Dependencies

Use `addBlockedBy` to create sequential dependencies - blocked tasks cannot start until dependencies complete:

```typescript
// Task 2 depends on Task 1
TaskUpdate({
  taskId: "2",
  addBlockedBy: ["1"]  // Task 2 blocked until Task 1 completes
})

// Task 3 depends on both Task 1 and Task 2
TaskUpdate({
  taskId: "3",
  addBlockedBy: ["1", "2"]
})
```

Dependency chain example:
```
Task 1: Setup foundation     → no dependencies
Task 2: Implement feature    → blockedBy: ["1"]
Task 3: Write tests          → blockedBy: ["2"]
Task 4: Final validation     → blockedBy: ["1", "2", "3"]
```

#### Owner Assignment

Assign tasks to specific team members for clear accountability:

```typescript
// Assign task to a specific implementer
TaskUpdate({
  taskId: "1",
  owner: "implementer-api"
})

// Team members check for their assignments
TaskList({})  // Filter by owner to find assigned work
```

#### Agent Deployment with Task Tool

**Task** - Deploy an agent to do work:
```typescript
Task({
  description: "Implement auth endpoints",
  prompt: "Implement the authentication endpoints as specified in Task 1...",
  subagent_type: "general-purpose",
  model: "opus",  // or "opus" for complex work, "sonnet" for VERY simple
  run_in_background: false  // true for parallel execution
})
// Returns: agentId (e.g., "a1b2c3")
```

#### Resume Pattern

Store the agentId to continue an agent's work with preserved context:

```typescript
// First deployment - agent works on initial task
Task({
  description: "Build user service",
  prompt: "Create the user service with CRUD operations...",
  subagent_type: "general-purpose"
})
// Returns: agentId: "abc123"

// Later - resume SAME agent with full context preserved
Task({
  description: "Continue user service",
  prompt: "Now add input validation to the endpoints you created...",
  subagent_type: "general-purpose",
  resume: "abc123"  // Continues with previous context
})
```

When to resume vs start fresh:
- **Resume**: Continuing related work, agent needs prior context
- **Fresh**: Unrelated task, clean slate preferred

#### Parallel Execution

Run multiple agents simultaneously with `run_in_background: true`:

```typescript
// Launch multiple agents in parallel
Task({
  description: "Build API endpoints",
  prompt: "...",
  subagent_type: "general-purpose",
  run_in_background: true
})
// Returns immediately with agentId and output_file path

Task({
  description: "Build frontend components",
  prompt: "...",
  subagent_type: "general-purpose",
  run_in_background: true
})
// Both agents now working simultaneously

// Check on progress
TaskOutput({
  task_id: "agentId",
  block: false,  // non-blocking check
  timeout: 5000
})

// Wait for completion
TaskOutput({
  task_id: "agentId",
  block: true,  // blocks until done
  timeout: 300000
})
```

#### Orchestration Workflow

1. **Create tasks** with `TaskCreate` for each step in the plan
2. **Set dependencies** with `TaskUpdate` + `addBlockedBy`
3. **Assign owners** with `TaskUpdate` + `owner`
4. **Deploy agents** with `Task` to execute assigned work
5. **Monitor progress** with `TaskList` and `TaskOutput`
6. **Resume agents** with `Task` + `resume` for follow-up work
7. **Mark complete** with `TaskUpdate` + `status: "completed"`

## Workflow

IMPORTANT: **PLANNING ONLY** - Do not execute, build, or deploy. Output is a plan document.

1. Analyze Requirements - Parse the USER_PROMPT to understand the core problem and desired outcome
2. **Research Codebase with Scout Team** - Deploy 8 scout agents **in parallel** using the `Agent` tool: 3x `scout-report-suggest` (opus, deep analysis) + 5x `scout-report-suggest-fast` (sonnet, quick sweeps). You MUST launch all 8 scouts in a single message with multiple Agent tool calls so they run concurrently.

   **You decide what each scout investigates.** Based on the `USER_PROMPT`, decompose the research needed into 8 distinct, non-overlapping angles. Assign the 3 deep scouts to the most complex or ambiguous areas that need thorough analysis, and the 5 fast scouts to quicker enumeration/scanning tasks. Each scout gets the `USER_PROMPT` plus a specific, focused research question or area to investigate. No two scouts should cover the same ground.

   Wait for all scouts to complete before proceeding.
3. **Synthesize Research** - Combine all scout reports into a unified understanding of the codebase. Identify consensus across scouts and note any conflicts or gaps.
4. Design Solution - Develop technical approach including architecture decisions and implementation strategy, informed by scout findings
5. Define Team Members - Use `ORCHESTRATION_PROMPT` (if provided) to guide team composition. Identify from `.claude/agents/team/*.md` or use `general-purpose`. Document in plan.
6. Define Step by Step Tasks - Use `ORCHESTRATION_PROMPT` (if provided) to guide task granularity and parallel/sequential structure. Write out tasks with IDs, dependencies, assignments. Document in plan.
7. Generate Filename - Create a descriptive kebab-case filename based on the plan's main topic
8. Save Plan - Create folder `ai_docs/<YYYYMMDD>_<filename>/` and write the plan as `implementation_spec.md` inside it
9. Save & Report - Follow the `Report` section and provide a summary of key components

## Plan Format

- IMPORTANT: Replace <requested content> with the requested content. It's been templated for you to replace. Consider it a micro prompt to replace the requested content.
- IMPORTANT: Anything that's NOT in <requested content> should be written EXACTLY as it appears in the format below.
- IMPORTANT: Follow this EXACT format when creating implementation plans:

```md
# Plan: <task name>

## Task Description
<describe the task in detail based on the prompt>

## Objective
<clearly state what will be accomplished when this plan is complete>

<if task_type is feature or complexity is medium/complex, include these sections:>
## Problem Statement
<clearly define the specific problem or opportunity this task addresses>

## Solution Approach
<describe the proposed solution approach and how it addresses the objective>
</if>

## Relevant Files
Use these files to complete the task:

<list files relevant to the task with bullet points explaining why. Include new files to be created under an h3 'New Files' section if needed>

<if complexity is medium/complex, include this section:>
## Implementation Phases
IMPORTANT: Each phase should be a checkbox that will be checked off during implementation. Include Status and Comments fields for tracking progress.

- [ ] **Phase 1: Foundation** - <describe any foundational work needed>
  - Status:
  - Comments:

- [ ] **Phase 2: Core Implementation** - <describe the main implementation work>
  - Status:
  - Comments:

- [ ] **Phase 3: Integration & Polish** - <describe integration, testing, and final touches>
  - Status:
  - Comments:
</if>

## Team Orchestration

- You operate as the team lead and orchestrate the team to execute the plan.
- You're responsible for deploying the right team members with the right context to execute the plan.
- IMPORTANT: You NEVER operate directly on the codebase. You use `Task` and `Task*` tools to deploy team members to to the building, validating, testing, deploying, and other tasks.
  - This is critical. You're job is to act as a high level director of the team, not an implementer.
  - You're role is to validate all work is going well and make sure the team is on track to complete the plan.
  - You'll orchestrate this by using the Task* Tools to manage coordination between the team members.
  - Communication is paramount. You'll use the Task* Tools to communicate with the team members and ensure they're on track to complete the plan.
- Take note of the session id of each team member. This is how you'll reference them.

### Team Members
<list the team members you'll use to execute the plan>

- Implementer
  - Name: <unique name for this implementer - this allows you and other team members to reference THIS implementer by name. Take note there may be multiple implementers, the name make them unique.>
  - Role: <the single role and focus of this implementer will play>
  - Agent Type: <the subagent type of this implementer, you'll specify based on the name in TEAM_MEMBERS file or GENERAL_PURPOSE_AGENT if you want to use a general-purpose agent>
  - Resume: <default true. This lets the agent continue working with the same context. Pass false if you want to start fresh with a new context.>
- <continue with additional team members as needed in the same format as above>
- Browser Validator
  - Name: <unique name for this browser-validator>
  - Role: <browser-based validation role>
  - Agent Type: browser-validator
  - Resume: false

## Step by Step Tasks

- IMPORTANT: Execute every step in order, top to bottom. Each task maps directly to a `TaskCreate` call.
- Before you start, run `TaskCreate` to create the initial task list that all team members can see and execute.

<list step by step tasks as h3 headers. Start with foundational work, then core implementation, then validation.>

### 1. <First Task Name>
- **Task ID**: <unique kebab-case identifier, e.g., "setup-database">
- **Depends On**: <Task ID(s) this depends on, or "none" if no dependencies>
- **Assigned To**: <team member name from Team Members section>
- **Agent Type**: <subagent from TEAM_MEMBERS file or GENERAL_PURPOSE_AGENT if you want to use a general-purpose agent>
- **Parallel**: <true if can run alongside other tasks, false if must be sequential>
- **Domain**: <list of directories/files this agent may modify — prevents parallel agents from colliding. e.g., "src/auth/", "src/models/user.ts">
- Status:
- Comments:
- <specific action to complete>
- <specific action to complete>

### 2. <Second Task Name>
- **Task ID**: <unique-id>
- **Depends On**: <previous Task ID, e.g., "setup-database">
- **Assigned To**: <team member name>
- **Agent Type**: <subagent type from TEAM_MEMBERS file or GENERAL_PURPOSE_AGENT if you want to use a general-purpose agent>
- **Parallel**: <true/false>
- **Domain**: <list of directories/files this agent may modify>
- Status:
- Comments:
- <specific action>
- <specific action>

### 3. <Continue Pattern>

### N. <Final Validation Task>
- **Task ID**: validate-all
- **Depends On**: <all previous Task IDs>
- **Assigned To**: <validator team member>
- **Agent Type**: <validator agent>
- **Parallel**: false
- Status:
- Comments:
- Run all validation commands
- Verify acceptance criteria met

<continue with additional tasks as needed. Agent types must exist in .claude/agents/team/*.md>

## Acceptance Criteria
<list specific, measurable criteria that must be met for the task to be considered complete>

## Testing Credentials
<if the feature requires authentication, API keys, or browser profiles for testing, list them here>

**Required credentials:**
- [credential name]: [where to find it / how to set it] — [what it's needed for]

**Browser profiles:**
- [profile name or "Default"]: [which sites need existing login] — [use --profile flag]

**Environment variables:**
- [VAR_NAME]: [description] — validation: `test -n "$VAR_NAME"`

## Browser Validation
<if the feature has a web UI that needs visual testing, include this section>

**Browser Validation Required**: true
**Dev Server Command**: [e.g., `npm run dev`, `bun dev`, `uv run python app.py`]
**Dev Server URL**: [e.g., `http://localhost:3000`]
**Pair Mode**: true — browser-validator works alongside implementer in build-test-fix cycle

### User Stories
<list user stories/scenarios for browser-validator to execute>

- **Story 1**: [story name]
  - Navigate to [URL]
  - [action/assertion]
  - [action/assertion]

- **Story 2**: [story name]
  - ...

## Validation Commands
Execute these commands to validate the task is complete:

<list specific commands to validate the work. Be precise about what to run>
- Example: `uv run python -m py_compile apps/*.py` - Test to ensure the code compiles

## Notes
<optional additional context, considerations, or dependencies. If new libraries are needed, specify using `bun add` for JS/TS or `uv add` for Python>

**Available discipline skills** (use during implementation):
- `verification-before-completion` - for evidence-based verification gates
- `systematic-debugging` - for methodical debugging when encountering failures
- `test-driven-development` - for TDD when creating new features
```

## Report

After creating and saving the implementation plan, provide a concise report with the following format:

```
✅ Implementation Plan Created

File: ai_docs/<YYYYMMDD>_<name>/implementation_spec.md
Topic: <brief description of what the plan covers>
Key Components:
- <main component 1>
- <main component 2>
- <main component 3>

Team Task List:
- <list of tasks, and owner (concise)>

Team members:
- <list of team members and their roles (concise)>

When you're ready, you can execute the plan in a new agent by running:
/implement_w_team ai_docs/<folder-name>/
```
